# Off-by-One Error in Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an off-by-one error in array iteration that leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the buggy code, while `FixedArray.java` shows the corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of careful loop indexing and array bound checking in Java.
